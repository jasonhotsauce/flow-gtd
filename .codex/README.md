# Codex Local Configuration

This folder contains repository-local Codex skills used by `AGENTS.md`.

## Skills

- `skills/testing-flow/SKILL.md`
- `skills/textual-ui/SKILL.md`
- `skills/macos-eventkit/SKILL.md`
- `skills/code-review-flow/SKILL.md`

These are migrated from the previous Cursor setup and tuned for Codex usage.
